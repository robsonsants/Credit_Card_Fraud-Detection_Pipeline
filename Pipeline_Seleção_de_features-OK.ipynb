    "A métrica roc_auc (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) é uma medida da capacidade de um modelo de classificação binária de distinguir entre duas classes. Especificamente, a área sob a curva ROC é calculada a partir do gráfico da curva ROC que plota a taxa de verdadeiros positivos (True Positive Rate - TPR) versus a taxa de falsos positivos (False Positive Rate - FPR) para diferentes valores de threshold (ponto de corte) usado para classificar as amostras como positivas ou negativas. A área sob a curva ROC é uma medida da qualidade geral do modelo, sendo que o valor máximo é 1, que indica um modelo perfeito. Um valor de 0,5 indica que o modelo não é melhor do que uma escolha aleatória. Em geral, quanto maior o valor da métrica, melhor o modelo é considerado em distinguir entre as duas classes."
